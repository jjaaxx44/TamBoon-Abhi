# TamBoon-Abhi
This is an assignment project for People Operation Team/Omise

Tamboon is a test for iOS dev @Omise
Few things to note,
	1	For sample project, I have pushed all pods as well. In live project it is better to just push pod file and rest of pod folders should be added in gits ".ignore"
	2	There are many pods used in sample project. Pods/third party libraries reduces development time, but adds extra overhead.
	3	Images used in app are royalty free images from https://icons8.com. Some images are edited using gimp
	4	Live project will have fork for implementation and pull request to merge with master
	5	localised strings can be used for error messages
	6	Swagger hub link
